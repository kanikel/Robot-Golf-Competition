### Robot Competition Code in RobotC
This is the source code for our team in [Build-A-Robot Competition 2018](https://roboorg.ri.cmu.edu/build-robot-competition-2018/) held by the Robotics Student Organization at CMU.

We have a lot of fun in the competition and saw many brilliant out-of-box vehicle models!
